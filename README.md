## Setup virtual environment
- We need to make venv inside the project to make the development easier
- if the virtual environment did not exist, create the environment by running ```python -m venv .venv``` to create venv called ".venv"
- activate the virtual environment by running ```.venv/scripts/activate```
- install the dependencies inside the virtual environment
- after installing, you can update the dependencies tracker by running ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
